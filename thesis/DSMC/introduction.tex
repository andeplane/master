Even though Molecular Dynamics is a very precise model that can give deep, detailed insight about advanced systems, it is computationally extremely expensive. As mentioned in section TODO, the size of a typical Molecular Dynamics system is of order a few nanometers. In nanoporous materials such as shales, the gas is dilute, so the said system might only have a few hundred free gas molecules. In this section, we will discuss 
\subsection{The model}
